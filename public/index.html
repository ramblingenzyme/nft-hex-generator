      <h1>RIP hexy boi maker</h1>
      <p>This site used to let you generate a hexagon profile picture for Twitter.</p>
      The timeline where widespread use of fake NFT profile pictures to clown on cryptobros has not come to pass.
      This was a good bit of fun while the feature didn't actually exist, but now I've decided to no longer deploy it.
      If for some reason you really really can't do without one, <a href="https://github.com/ramblingenzyme/nft-hex-generator/tree/archive">the Github repository is here.</a></p>
